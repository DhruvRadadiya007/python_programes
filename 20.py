"""Python comments
Comments are descriptions that help programmers
better understand the intent and functionality of the
program. They are completely ignored by the Python
interpreter.

Python docstrings
As mentioned above, Python docstrings are strings
used right after the definition of a function, method,
class, or module (like in Example 1). They are used to
document our code.
We can access these docstrings using the doc
attribute."""


"""PEP 8 is a document that provides guidelines and
best practices on how to write Python code. It was
written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw,
and Nick Coghlan. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to
improve the readability and consistency of Python
code.
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and
there are several of them. A PEP is a document that
describes new features proposed for Pyth4(n and
documents aspects of Python, like design and style,
for the community."""
